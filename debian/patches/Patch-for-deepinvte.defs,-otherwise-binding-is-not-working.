 .
 deepinvte (1:0.28.2-5ubuntu1) quantal; urgency=low
 .
   * Resynchronise with Debian (libexecdir fix closes LP: #864609).
     Remaining changes:
     - debian/patches/91_keep_fds.patch:
       - deepinvte does not support G_SPAWN_LEAVE_DESCRIPTORS_OPEN when calling
         deepinvte_terminal_fork_command_full().
     - debian/patches/93_add_alt_screen_scroll_toggle.patch:
       - Handle scrolling differently when using alternate screen or
         scrolling is restricted.
     - debian/patches/lp246701_scroll_region_updates.patch:
       - Fix update glitch related to scroll regions.
     - debian/patches/backscroll-stream-mem.patch:
       - Provide a memory-based scrollback stream backend to avoid hitting
         disk with terminal contents.
   * Add version for deepinvte_terminal_set_alternate_screen_scroll to
     libdeepinvte9.symbols (probably a bit too tight, but due to changelog
     truncation this is the best I could readily manage).
