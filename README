* What is DEEPINVTE?

DEEPINVTE is a library (libdeepinvte) implementing a terminal emulator widget for GTK+,
and a minimal sample application (deepinvte) using that.  Deepinvte is mainly used in
gnome-terminal, but can also be used to embed a console/terminal in games,
editors, IDEs, etc.

DEEPINVTE supports Unicode and character set conversion, as well as emulating any
terminal known to the system's terminfo database.

DEEPINVTE doesn't have a homepage.  Report any issues at:
